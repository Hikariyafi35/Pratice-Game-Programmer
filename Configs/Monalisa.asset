  Description: "he Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist
    Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, 
    \t\t\t\tit has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most
    written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world\". 
    \t\t\t\tThe painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression,
    the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the
    atmospheric illusionism."
